Patients Name: Mr. XXXXXX XXX
Referred by: Dr. X XXXXXXXX
Date Taken: 2/7/16
Date of Report: 2/7/16
Patients Complaint: Non-productive cough and malaise.
Patients History: Non-contributory.
Findings:
Radiographic examination of the chest by means of PA and lateral projections reveals ill-defined
consolidation within the medial aspect of the right middle lobe (Boyden segment #5) obliterating
the right cardiac margin (positive silhouette sign). The tracheal silhouette is midline and the
lungfields appear well-pneumatized without atelectasis.
The cardiac silhouette is of normal size and configuration. The visualized rib margins are
unremarkable.
Impressions:
1. Right middle lobe consolidation compatible with acute pneumonitis. Referral for sputum
culture and medical co-management is strongly recommended. Serial chest radiography is
suggested until resolution.
