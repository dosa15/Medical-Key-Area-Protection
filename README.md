Initial idea:
[/idea folder]
This project involves hiding a diagnostic report in a medical scan using steganography, following which the stego image is blurred using a image blurring or distortion algorithm. 

Final project:
[/final folder]
This project converts a diagnostic report to a QR code, allows user to manually identify the key area in a medical image, and embeds the QR onto the selected key area. The key area is extracted and steganographically hidden in the resultant image, which subsequently blurs the QR code as well. This final output is both secure and hides the key area from public eyes.
